Clock Exercises 

1. core.wait averaged 2.0017 s in 2 trials with 6 measurements - it is quite accurate but not exact
- Since experimental design requires extremely precise measures, core.wait is likely unacceptable 

2. clock + while loops averaged 2.0042 s through 2 trials with 6 measurements - similar results to core.wait were found 
 - depending on the precision required, it is possible this would be unnacceptable as well  

3. countdown timer + while loops averaged 2.0160 in 2 trials with 6 measurements - however, it should be noted that individual timer values were much more consistent to each other 
- while the other methods resulted in a value closer to 2s, their individual values showed a larger degree of varience, whereas the countdown timer showed greater consistency
