Clock Exercises 

1. core.wait averaged 2.0017 s in 2 trials with 6 measurements - it is quite accurate but not exact
- Since experimental design requires extremely precise measures, core.wait is likely unacceptable 

2. clock + while loops averaged 2.0042 s through 2 trials with 6 measurements - similar results to core.wait were found 
 - depending on the precision required, it is possible this would be unnacceptable as well
